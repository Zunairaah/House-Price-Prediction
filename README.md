📌 Projects Highlights:

🧹 Preprocessed the dataset: Handled numeric features, applied MinMaxScaler, and converted the target variable into binary classification using the median split.

⚙️ Trained & Tuned Multiple Models:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

🧪 Used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning to improve performance.

📊 Evaluated all models on Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

📈 Visualized model performance using comparison plots for accuracy vs F1-score.

🛠️ Tools Used:
Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, Google Colab

📊 Outcome:
I learned how to handle numeric-only datasets for classification tasks and how hyperparameter tuning can dramatically impact results. This task helped me deepen my understanding of performance evaluation using cross-validation and metric-based comparisons.
